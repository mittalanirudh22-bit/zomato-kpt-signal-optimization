## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurate Kitchen Prep Time (KPT) prediction is critical for:

- Accurate ETA estimation
- Reducing rider waiting time
- Lowering cancellations
- Improving platform efficiency

Current systems rely heavily on **merchant-marked Food Ready (FOR)** signals, which are often noisy and biased.

The core issue is not model complexity — it is **signal quality**.

## 🎯 Our Approach

We redesign the signal layer instead of only improving the model.

The solution introduces:

- 🔹 Order Complexity Signals  
- 🔹 Kitchen Load Index (KLI)  
- 🔹 Merchant Reliability Modeling  
- 🔹 Rush Hour Congestion Adjustment  
- 🔹 Signal-Driven ML Prediction
